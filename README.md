Terminal based app to split the bills.

If you have went to a trip with your friends you would have realized it is difficult to keep track of transactions that are made. We have developed a terminal based application that helps you to settle up your expenses once you finish your trip.

* Created our own database just using txt files.
* You can make groups and subgroups.
* Add the expenses precentagewise, ratiowise, moneywise.
